			    <h2>Intro</h2>
                <p>ForcedFable is a gaming culture blog aimed at reviewing, discussing, and of course - playing the latest in video game entertainment. We collaborated with the great group of guys at ForcedFable to build a central location on the web for consolidating their different digital media presences.</p>
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>The first step was to work with the client to establish the goals of the platform. They knew they wanted some form a centralized digital presence that linked to their different forms of media - specifically YouTube, Twitter, and Twitch.TV.</p>
                <p>Initially, a document outlining our assumptions of the projects end goals. Because this project was somewhat unorthodox in that there was not client provided specifications, we opted to use collaborative writing tools (specifically Google Docs) to define project requirements with the current members of the ForcedFable team.</p>
                <h2>Designing</h2>
                <img src="/images/forcedfablemocks.jpg">
                <p>As we iterated on the requirements, it became clear that the focus of the website was going to be the merging of they guys’ different social media accounts. Because much of ForcedFable’s work is based on multiple third-party video services, we had to find a way to seamlessly integrate these different sources in a way that didn’t compromise the integrity of the ForcedFable brand. We categorized video content as either live (Twitch.TV streams) or pre-recorded (YouTube), and architected the site accordingly.</p>
                <p>After the client was comfortable with the requirements we had laid out together, the wire-framing stage began. Hand drawn sketches were scanned and sent to the client for approval, and after a handful of iterations were approved for full design.</p>
                <p>We then set out on making a full visual design in Photoshop that wowed the client on the first go and was heavily inspired by the fictional shadow sect Cerberus from the popular video game series Mass Effect.</p>
                <p>We agreed at that point that any design iteration would be best done in-browser, as our workflow at BTG tends to shy away from using Photoshop at all. With a tentatively approved design mocked and coded, it was time to dig into the development.</p>
                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>WordPress was the natural choice for this project, as it provided a means to architect the different types of information on the site in a clear and concise way. By closely coupling blog posts and pre-recorded video posts, the guys are able to easily create the different types of content without having to deal with an overly complicated dashboard system.</p>
                <p>We were also lucky enough to stumble across the Twitch TV Embed Suite WordPress plugin (by Plumeria Web Design) which we leveraged to create the live streaming and site-wide stream notifications.</p>
                <h2>Finishing Touches</h2>
                <p>We have since continued to work with the ForcedFable team to squash bugs and update design decisions based on user feedback and basic usage.</p>
                <h2>Client Response</h2>
                <p>“Working with Jordan has been a pleasure. His website design was just what we were looking for. Any time we have wanted something altered or adapted, he has delivered.” - Jordan Bohr</p>
