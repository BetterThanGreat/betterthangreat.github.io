			    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>GraphSnap is the brainchild of Jordan Shaw, and attempts to create a major paradigm shift in the bioinformatics sector. As we all know, many companies today are stuck using software built on outdated platforms and without the user in mind. GraphSnap seeks to fix this. Built on emerging (yet stable) technologies like Node.js and designed with the user in mind, GraphSnap will revolutionize how companies that rely on biological data can interact with that information.</p>
                <p>We currently collaborate with Shaw and his biotech company, BioBacTrac to continue to build on and improve both the GraphSnap application and marketing based external site.</p>
                <p>Please keep in mind that this project is currently being built and is considered to be in the Alpha stages of development.</p>
                <h2>Experience Planning</h2>
                <img src="/images/graphsnapmocks.jpg">
                <p>GraphSnap is built with the future biotech lab in mind - and that future is quickly transitioning away from the desktop. Lab technicians want to be able to track data immediately upon discovery. Rather than dictating written data into a desktop that could be offices away, GraphSnap is will allow users to enter data from their tablet or smartphone without having to leave the lab.</p>
                <p>Because GraphSnap is still technically an HTML5 web application and not a native app (this is intentional to reach as many devices at launch as is possible) is is inherently responsive, and boasts many mobile UX best practices.</p>
                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>Design and development have been done in tandem for this project, as the two are not so deeply rooted. Because this is a data-driven application, the pipeline for data is quite a bit less flexible than the visual output of said data. In that way, the application is primarily API-driven (this is also intentional, as this will pave the way for future applications that consume our REST API), and is built using Node.js and the fabulous Express.js framework.</p>
